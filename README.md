# TaskForge â€” Library-style Starter (Books & Authors + Auth + Swagger)

This repository is a *working* starter backend for the CSE341 final project, built from a proven Project 2 foundation.
It uses the native `mongodb` driver, Passport (GitHub strategy optional), JWT auth for API access, and `swagger-autogen` to produce `/api-docs`.

Use this repo as the canonical base for Week 1 (W05): create two collections (authors + books) with full CRUD, error handling,
and published API documentation at `/api-docs`. From here you will add the rest of your project (projects, tasks, comments, etc).
